# Business Cycle Simulation  
**Simulating the Business Cycle using a Phillips Curve and Taylor Rule**

This project implements a simple macroeconomic model combining:

- **Phillips Curve** – inflation dynamics  
- **Taylor Rule** – policy interest rate adjustment  
- **Output gap equation** – economic activity fluctuations  
- **Random shocks** – add volatility to macroeconomic behavior  

The notebook simulates how **inflation**, **output gap**, and **interest rate** evolve over time in response to economic shocks and policy rules.

## Project Overview

This model demonstrates:

- How inflation responds to output-gap pressures  
- How central banks adjust interest rates using a Taylor-type rule  
- How randomness influences macroeconomic cycles  
- How simulated economic variables co-move over time
